Rho
---

The Rho package is an analysis tool kit for use with ROOT. 
It owes a lot to it's predecessors, including ALPHA from ALEPH 
and BaBar's Beta. Unlike Beta, Rho is based on the solid fundaments 
of the freely available ROOT framework and runs interactively 
out-of-the-box on all computing platforms supporting ROOT. 
Rho fully complies to the ROOT coding conventions and is free of 
commercial components: There is no need for additional products like 
CLHEP, PDT or RogueWave Tools.h++ as ROOT already offers the 
corresponding functionality. Rho has been very carefully optimised 
to interactive work and thus speed:

- Communication between modules in general happens through abstract 
  interfaces rather than transient objects
- The consequent use of smart pointers to the ROOT data store allows 
  to filter events at several 100 kHz on a standard PC
- The consequent use of ROOTD for file I/O allows for efficient 
  interactive access to data distributed over various Tier sites
- The consequent use of the "new with placement" operator for 
  recruitment of analysis objects out of a fixed memory arena 
  prevents memory fragmentation even in long lasting jobs
- A built-in garbage collection mechanism resolves the burden of 
  ownership issues for candidates and vertices (Dont care)


Availability and Installation
-----------------------------

Rho resides in the CVS repository :ext:anoncvs@gridportal.fzk.de:/cvs/hep/rho. 
If you wish to install and build, you have to check out and build the 
corresponding packages:

First, you should set the CVS environment

> setenv CVSROOT :ext:anoncvs@gridportal.fzk.de:/cvs/hep/rho
> setenv CVS_RSH ssh

Then, install a release directory (The environment RHO needs to be set up 
to point to the directory):

> mkdir Rho
> cd Rho
> setenv RHO $PWD
> mkdir bin lib workdir

You might want to check out and read documentation first (htmldoc holds 
the ROOT class documentation):

> cvs co doc
> cvs co htmldoc

Then check out the Rho sources and start the build:

> cvs -z3 -t co RhoMakefiles
> RhoMakefiles/addRho
> make f RhoMakefiles/GNUmakefile.Linux

Prior to start you should install the most recent production version of ROOT 
from root.cern.ch and set the ROOTSYS environment variable correspondingly. 
In addition you have to add $ROOTSYS/lib and $RHO/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
in order to resolve the shared libs.

A Windows distribution is available upon request.
