PAFExamples README file
   Marcel Kunze, Mar 2k

This package holds example programs for the PAF:
 - PAFAnalysis.cc hunts for the golden channel (JPsiKs)
 - gammagamma.cc shows how to use the new event selectors to skim data
 - twoprong.cc is a simple twoprong filter based on the TAG
 - dimuon.cc is a filter based on the AOD
 - hadronic.cc is more advanced and selects and analyzes hadronic events
 - y4sfit.cc skims the data from the scan run using selectors and fits the Y(4S)
 - MuMuAnalysis.cc is a rewrite of Chris Hearty's unbiased muon selection
 - incBDstarPi.cc is an example for inclusive skim of the D*Pi channel

Make sure to have set the PAF environment correctly:
'source pafboot' out of the PAF directory or set the PAF variables in your .cshrc
